# FireDetection
Fire Detection System for GDG hackathon 2022
Using Python libraries such as Tensorflow, numpy, ImageDetection among others.

Fire Detection Model was made using Machine Learning of over 100 files and 5000 steps to maximize accuracy.
The model can detect Major Fires upto 60% accuracy and Minor Fires upto 55% accuracy.
Non Fire situations can be detected with 72% accuracy.

A Real Time Fire Detection System to be implemented in the surveillance network of cities to avoid and combat major and minor fire hazards when they arise.

Heres a simulation of a camera not detecting fire:

And Lastly Major Fire which would trigger an emergecy call (to be implemented) to Fire Dept.:

# What's Next:

API calls to emergency Fire Dept.

Uploading the model to Google Cloud Services.

Implementing a Flutter app to provide the service on IOS/Android devices.
